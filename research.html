<h5>Gender in Conflict: A Dynamic Theory of Ethnonationalist Armed Groups’ Recruitment and Non-Recruitment of Female Combatants</h5>

<p>My dissertation investigates three questions pertaining to the recruitment practices of armed
ethno-nationalist organizations. First, why do ethno-nationalist organizations recruit women?
Second, what roles do these women typically perform in these organizations? And third, is it
possible to predict the timing of women’s recruitment into armed ethno-nationalist organizations?
Scholars have primarily focused on the religious, ethnic, political and economic variables that may
trigger insurgent recruitment but seldom is recruitment studied as a gendered phenomenon. The
dissertation addresses this understudied research area by providing a systematic explanation of the
conditions under which ethno-nationalist leaders defy their communities’ gender norms and recruit
women into traditionally male roles, such as combatant. I explore how changing conflict conditions
such as fluctuations in the groups’ military capabilities, their relationship with the civilians
under their control and the groups’ degree of territorial control affect the likelihood that the
insurgent leadership will recruit women as combatants. To test my arguments, I examine the
recruitment strategies of four ethno-nationalist organizations: the Eritrean Liberation Front and
the Karen National Union/Liberation Army, which did not recruit female combatants and the Eritrean
People’s Liberation Front and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which recruited women into
combat roles. Primary data for this project was collected using elite interviews conducted during
field research in Thailand and Burma/Myanmar.</p>
